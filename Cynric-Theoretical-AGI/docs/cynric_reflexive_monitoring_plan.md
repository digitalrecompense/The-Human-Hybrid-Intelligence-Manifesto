# Cynric Reflexive Monitoring Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
Implement Cynric's reflexive monitoring system for coherence checks with typed hybrid reasoning graphs and bounded monitoring protocols.

## Requirements Analysis

- [x] Review Cynric native types (cynric_types_integration_plan.md)
- [x] Design typed hybrid reasoning graph 𝒞 = (G, R)
- [x] Implement node type system 𝒯 = {neural, symbolic, ethical, memory}
- [x] Create reflexive monitor R with bounded checks
- [x] Develop Zero-Separation enforcement (dO ≤ ε)
- [x] Implement Empathy constraint checking (E ≥ Emin)
- [x] Build typing progress and preservation mechanisms
- [x] Design coherence enforcement methods
- [x] Create bounded monitoring protocols
- [x] Ensure continuous operation without system halting
