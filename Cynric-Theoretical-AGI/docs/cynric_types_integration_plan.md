# Cynric Native Types Integration Plan

## Task Overview
Integrate Cynric's native types (tensor, symbol, belief, ethics, trace, context, invariant) into the system architecture design with semantic and moral continuity preservation.

## Native Cynric Types to Integrate
1. **Tensor** - Multi-dimensional data structures
2. **Symbol** - Named entities and relationships
3. **Belief** - Confidence-weighted assertions
4. **Ethics** - Moral constraint frameworks
5. **Trace** - Reasoning path tracking
6. **Context** - Situational environment data
7. **Invariant** - Unchanging properties/constraints

## Key Requirements
- [x] Zero-Separation principles enforcement at type level
- [x] Empathy constraints embedded in type definitions
- [x] Built-in ethical field types
- [x] Mathematical specifications for each type
- [x] Type checking algorithms
- [x] Semantic continuity preservation
- [x] Moral continuity proofs
- [x] Technology stack updates

## Research Steps
1. [x] Read existing architecture files
2. [x] Analyze current system design
3. [x] Design enhanced type systems
4. [x] Create mathematical specifications
5. [x] Develop type checking algorithms
6. [x] Design moral continuity mechanisms
7. [x] Update technology stack requirements
8. [x] Generate comprehensive integration document
